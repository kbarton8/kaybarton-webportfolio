    <h4>1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business. </h4>
    Information technology (IT) is defined as "the application of computers and internet to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information" (Prasad, 2017:54) holds a huge purpose in modern business today for several reasons. <br> The majority of modern-day business have benefited hugely from the digital revolution even businesses you wouldn't image to have benefited have such as agriculture as farmers use computers for production planning, financial planning etc (Business Vibes, 2015).<br> IT has many obvious, simple purposes such as allowing businesses to sell products online, enabling communication, providing education however this is just the foundation. <br>
    IT allows business to:<br>
    - Access the tools needed to solve complex problems.<br>
    - Make better decisions<br>
    - Improve marketing <br>
    - Improved customer support<br>
    - Improved resource management <br>
    - Perform tasks quicker, providing efficiency <br>

    <h4> 1.2 Describing the methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h4>
    In order to successfully complete a digital project specific methods, skill and resources are required. <br>
    Skills:<br>
    For a person to achieve this successful project it is important that they have a strong set of communication and organization skills. Also, an attention to detail would be beneficial as well as being a driven, consistent and having the ability to multi-task and solve problems. <br>
    Resources:<br>
    Resources needed would include access to a computer system which would vary per project, some can be completed on a desktop, laptop and even mobile phone or iPad/tablet. Other resources for a successful project may include: Access to the internet, Access to indefinite amount of time, certain software and programs. <br>
    Methods:<br>
    When using your resources, it's best to be wise and efficient. When working in this industry travelling may be necessary and it won’t always be possible to travel with for example a desktop therefore a laptop would provide more portability. <br>

    <h4> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website. </h4>
    
    To make a website, it's important there is good planning in order to keep the project running efficiently. One way of keeping yourself organised is by using the website 'Trello'. Trello allows you add record your journey whilst adding things that you have finished, yet to do, or in completion of doing.

    <h4>1.4	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects. </h4>

    Digital projects always have the chance of failing unfortunately which can come down to a number of reasons. Some of these reasons may be hard to avoid. If a person has a lack of recourses when trying to complete the project, the completion time mat become affected. Other risks can include: if local servers go down or crash the risk of losing work is increased therefore leading to lost projects. Slow internet can also become a problem when companies are trying to upload projects or communicate. 
    Further project risks may include time, if the project is taking longer than expected. Cost risk, performance risk, risks from outside the business e.g. if a competitor releases their project before you and draws your customers away. Additionally, if you do not have the correct amount of people or budget this can become a risk.
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>1.5	Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software. </h4>

    It is important to select the correct software and use of IT system to make the project run smoothly and to avoid any complications. As stated above, it would be logical and be more efficient if a laptop was used when traveling. Research needs to be implemented when starting a project in order to know which software would be more beneficial, just as knowing which language to code in for the desired project to ultimately reach your desired outcomes. 
</div>
        
<div>
    <h4>1.6	Describe and prove analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h4>

    Throughout projects the website 'Trello' was used in order to keep a high level of organization and to keep projects running smoothly. With the help of Trello different members of the team can keep up to date with where each other are up to and what tasks are set or have been completed.  Other programs such as 'Trinket' are beneficial as code can be loaded and shared. The use of Visual Studio Code can be used to achieve the code in different languages such as Python for coding a game or HTML/CSS to develop a website. The use of Github has also been beneficial and allowed me to achieve completion of my project as i wa able to use this software to upload all my files to a live website that the public can view. 
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>1.7	Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h4>

    One legal guideline that is becoming increasingly important is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is the core of Europe’s digital privacy legislation (Palmer, 2019) and was adopted on April 14 2016 then enforced on May 25 2018. The purpose of GDPR is to allow EU citizens more control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for business so both citizens and businesses in the EU can fully benefit from the digital economy. GDPR is important as It improves the protection of European data subjects’ rights and clarifies what companies that process personal data must do to safeguard these rights (Visma, n/d). In the past, there have been countless breaches of data which can result in long lasting negative effects. One example of this is when the NHS suffered a data breach in 2018 which resulted in 150,000 patients in England being affected. Another recent case is the company EasyJet who are now facing an £18 billion class-action lawsuit over a data breach which resulted in the information of nine million customers being exposed (Osborne, 2020).

    <h4>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website.</h4>

    When making my website various tools were used. First a Trello board was created which I found very useful in keeping me aware of what I needed to do and where I was with the project as i was able to mark down each individual task i needed to complete to finish my website. To create the code Visual Studio Code was used which I again got on with very well, one of the positives of Visual Studio Code was when you are adding code it comes up with suggestions to what you can use which was very helpful and sped up the process. I did not use Code pen however in the future I would like to trial it to see if it would be more beneficial to me. 
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h4>   
    All IT tools selected were appropriate for the completion of this project. They all worked together in order for this website to be created, making the project more efficient. The different tools used included: Slack for communication, Zoom for communication, Visual Studio Code for the creation of the code, Trello for a way to track progress. I also found good use from the website https://www.w3schools.com/ it offers many tutorials which guided me throughout. 
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h4>  
    After the completion of my website there are several strengths and weaknesses that arose. Firstly, the strengths include how much I enjoyed this project and it gave me an insight into a career I could enjoy. I particularly liked the home page of my website after using the website we3school I was able to add music that auto played however one negative side of this was the song may become repetitive. Weaknesses of my website included I am yet to know how to make videos follow a layout so they're close to each other without the control bars overlapping eachother. 
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h4>
    There are many further improvements that need to be made to my website which I will tackle over time in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing and work better with no bugs. Adding columns will be my next task to tackle to make the presentation better as well as adding more elements so that the website is more interactive.
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h4>    
    I navigated myself through my website to make sure it worked fine, when doing so I came across a video which I had uploaded to auto play and realised I was not able to pause the video. I found this to not be user friendly, so removed the video and uploaded it to YouTube. By doing this I could implement the video onto the page by embedding it and it was able to auto play but be able to have the option to be paused.
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h4> 
    The first project in Code Nation required the creation of a game in python which was made in a team of 5, when making the website we worked independently with the same amount of time as previous. If a team had been used to create a website, then yes it may have been more efficient and been able to excel further however it was good to work alone on this project as we could use our individual preferred ideas therefore making it more personal. 
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h4>    
    To improve productivity and efficiency more thorough learning could have taken place before implanting ideas onto the website. This would reduce any areas that used trial and error. 
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h4>    
    Working to a stricter schedule and keeping a timetable may improve productivity. Checking and updating Trello more, asking more questions. Using any extra time to keep increasing knowledge by using different websites to learn new elements of code.
</div>
    
<div>
    <h4>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h4>
    To test my website, I made sure that every link in the navigation bar worked and no bugs were present. On the pages that included videos I made sure that they all played all the way through with good sound and video quality. On the home page where there was auto play music present, I made sure this could be paused.
