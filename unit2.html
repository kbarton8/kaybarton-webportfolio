        <h4> 1.5 Describing the copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h4>
        If you are wanting to use anything on your website that you do not own for example an image or video if it is watermarked or signed then you are not able to do this without the owner's permission which is why careful consideration was taken into what images were included. If you do not get permission, there is the risk of the owner suing you.

        <h4> 1.6 Describing issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h4>
        It is important to make sure when creating a website, the whole target audience is considered. By doing this you will understand you need to make the website friendly to those who have difficulty’s or disabilities. For those who are visually impaired larger text would be more suitable, or a specific colour of text. One way to enable user friendly experience could be to make a neighbour website those who have impairments can click to have an easier version to understand.
